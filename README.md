# Ayurclinic
A web application that keeps track of patients and the medicines they take
<br>
run ```python manage.py makemigrations``` and
```python manage.py migrate``` to create the database
<br>
<br>
Then you would have to login to django admin site and manually add medicine names along with its price to the table
so that you can choose respective ones for individual patients
<br>
I wanted to stop using bootstrapðŸ¥´ and i am bad very bad with designing UIs,hence the design is just basic html
<br>
So, I'm sorry but this application is designed only for mobile devices and is not a responsive design actually i was just tryin to build something that someone could actually make use of
<br>
